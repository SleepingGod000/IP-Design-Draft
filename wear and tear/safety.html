		<h1>Safety tips for users.</h1>
		
		<h2>Buyers</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Items that are listed way below the standard Manufacturer's Suggested Retail Price(MSRP) are usually too good to be true. Avoid these types of listing and report them as soon as possible.</li>
				
				<li>*You are held responsible for the items that you have purchased. No refunds are allowed.</li>
				
				<li>Check the rating of the seller. A higher seller rating means that the majority of the other users are satisfied with the items that they purchased from that seller.</li>
				
				<li>Check the review and rating of the item that is posted by other users.</li>
			</ol>

		<h2>Sellers</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>When listing the item for sale, include the necessary and relevant pictures that represents the product that you are selling.</li>
				
				<li>Include proper description regarding the products that you are listing for sale.</li>
				
				<li>For 2nd hand listings, make sure to include the current condition of the item. If there are any wear/tear/scratch marks, list it down and include the pictures that shows those wear/tear/scratch marks.</li>
				
				<li>One item is allowed per listing but is not limited to the color variety that is available for that item.</li>
			</ol>
		<h2>Users</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Practice communicating with other users on the forum in a civilized manner.</li>
				
				<li>Provide accurate information to users that are misinformed and want further clarification.</li>
				
				<li>Forum posts that are targated at hate/violance/crime will not be tolerated and will result in a ban of your account without any warning.</li>
				
				<li>Do not reveal you personal information on the forum.</li>
